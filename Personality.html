            <ul type="circle"></ul>
            <li>Resilience is my strongest trait, and it plays a vital role in how I approach my studies.<br>
            When faced with challenges, I try my very best to stay focused and push through obstacles.</li></br>

            <li>An emotion that would describe me is that I am a very neutral and calm person.<br>
            With this, I try to approach challenges effectively without letting stress and anxiety cloud my judgment.</li></br>

            <li>One of my hobbies is crocheting. Crocheting requires patience, precision, and attention to detail.<br>
            These are qualities that are important when coding. This practice helps me to develop patience and focus, which I carry over into my studies.</li></br>

            <h2><b><center><i>MY HERO</i></center></b></h2>
            <ul type="circle"></ul>
            <li>My heroes are my parents, and I choose them because they are my best motivators.<br>
            They always encourage me to do my very best, which I appreciate so much. My favorite quote from my parents would be, "Always strive to do your best. You're not perfect, so eventually, you will make mistakes along the way."
            I love this because it lets me know that no matter what, they are proud of me.</li></br>

            <p>I would say that this personality test was very accurate.</p>
